# AmiGame-Hxc
This (dirty written) software allow you to select a folder containing HFE file in TOSEC format naming and order them.
The binary version will come very soon !!!!

##How it works ?
This soft order and sort hfe files by Name and Disk Order.
ex : GameName (1989)(Developper)(M3)[cr mGGk]_adf.hfe become GameName.hfe
For games with multiple disks it create a folder with the game name and rename all files by their disk number

##Future of this soft ?
I made this on a lazy sunday, because i don't want to rename files one by one. The code is quite dirty (i'm not proud of it) and it's in C# (not crossplatform, haven't tried it with wine)
The C++ will be a better version (I promise !)

##TODO
* Implement converting system (file.XXX to file.hfe)
* Display game info on selecting in the list
* Custom pattern form file name

##Why this name
I've created it to order amiga game on my SD Card for my HxC on my Amiga 500 !

##Licence
GPL v3 (file will come too)
